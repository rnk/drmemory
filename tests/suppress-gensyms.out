# 4 unaddressable access, 4 uninitialized access and 4 leak errors are
# generated by the test.  For each of the 4, the first two will be suppressed
# mod+offs style (i.e., inside libdrmemory.so) and the latter two by mod!func
# suppression in postprocess.pl.
# with PR 477013 the summary is printed by postprocess after both types of
# suppression.
