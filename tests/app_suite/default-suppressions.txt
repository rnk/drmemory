# We use these suppressions to silence the known reports, especially false
# positive reports. This way we can achieve a 'clean' run of tests that have
# no errors in the code and make sure no new reports appear over time.
#
# Each suppression should have a link to the corresponding Dr. Memory issue.
# Before marking an issue as Fixed, please take time to remove the
# corresponding suppressions from this file.
