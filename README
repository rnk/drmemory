What is Dr. Memory?

Dr. Memory is a memory monitoring tool capable of identifying
memory-related programming errors such as accesses of uninitialized memory,
accesses to unaddressable memory (including outside of allocated heap units
and heap underflow and overflow), accesses to freed memory, double frees,
memory leaks, and access to un-reserved thread local storage slots (on
Windows).

Dr. Memory is based on the DynamoRIO binary translation engine.  Dr. Memory
currently targets 32-bit Windows, Linux, and ESXi only.
