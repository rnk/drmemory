\section sec_windows Setup on Windows

This section describes requirements, setup instructions, and other concerns
prior to running Dr. Memory on Windows.

Please note that Dr. Memory does not yet have full support for the Windows
graphical system calls, leading to extra false positives, particularly on
Windows Vista and Windows 7.  Future releases will eliminate these; for
now, suppression files can be used.

********************
\subsection sec_windows_utils Utilities

Dr. Memory displays results using \p notepad by default.  If it is not on
the PATH a message pointing to the file containing the results will be
displayed.  The option \p -batch can be used to disable the launch of \p
notepad at application exit.

********************
\subsection sec_windows_cygwin Dr. Memory and MinGW or Cygwin

Dr. Memory supports applications compiled with the MinGW gcc or g++
compilers, but will only provide line number information if DWARF2
debugging information is present.  The default for MinGW gcc prior to
version 4.3 is to use the stabs format, which is not supported by
Dr. Memory.  Pass the -ggdb option to gcc to generate DWARF2 format
instead.

For MinGW C++ applications, Dr. Memory also requires the use of static
libstdc++ libraries.  Pass "-static-libgcc -static-libstdc++" to g++ to
request this.  Since these static libraries contain frame pointer
optimizations, we recommend passing the "-no_callstack_use_top_fp" runtime
option to Dr. Memory.  This option is also discussed below.  Dr. Memory
attempts to automatically use this setting when it executes an application
built with MinGW.

Currently there is no support for applications built with Cygwin gcc.

The regular Dr. Memory build can be executed just fine from a Cygwin
shell when targeting non-Cygwin applications.

\endhtmlonly
\section sec_running Running Dr. Memory

The first step is to unzip or untar the Dr. Memory package.

********************
\subsection sec_app_prep Prepare Your Application

In order to obtain line number information, compile your target
application with debugging information enabled (e.g., "/Zi" for cl.exe
or "-g" for gcc or g++).

On Linux, Dr. Memory supports ELF files with DWARF2 line information.  On
Windows, Dr. Memory supports PDB debug information (produced by Visual
Studio) as well as PECOFF files with DWARF2 line information (produced by
MinGW gcc or g++: see \ref sec_windows_cygwin).

If you want to run your application with stripped libraries or binaries and
have the unstripped versions in separate locations, you can point at those
locations using the \p DRMEMORY_LIB_PATH environment variable, which is a
colon-separated list of directories.

On Windows, while the debug DLL C library (specified with the "/MDd" flag) is
supported, its use requires Dr. Memory to disable some of its error
detection.  We recommend building your application with either the
release DLL ("/MD") or the release or debug static library ("/MT" or
"/MTd"), although "/MTd" is not recommended (see below).  When using Visual
Studio, the release library can be selected from Visual Studio's
configuration dialog (press Alt-F7 to bring it up) under the C/C++ | Code
Generation | Runtime Library settings.  Change "Multi-threaded Debug DLL
(/MDd)" to "Multi-threaded DLL (/MD)".  If your application is C++, another
step is necessary when using /MD to avoid the C++ Debug DLL:
under Configuration Properties | C/C++ | Preprocessor, remove
"_DEBUG" from the list of "Preprocessor Definitions".

On Windows, when using debug versions of the C library (when building with
the "/MTd" flag ("/MDd" is not supported at all), you will not be able to
control the redzone size.  The debug heap checks will mostly be disabled as
they overlap and can conflict with Dr. Memory's checks.  It is recommended
that the release version of the heap routines be used.  Additionally, when
using static debug versions of msvcrt (the "/MTd" flag), if your
application does not have symbols then Dr. Memory will not be able to
identify and avoid conflicts with msvcrt's own heap debugging facilities,
which may lead to false positives and/or false negatives.  Be sure to build
with debugging information included.

You'll get better callstacks in error reports if you disable inlining.  For
cl.exe, "/Ob0", or for gcc or g++, "-fno-inline".  Dr. Memory should be
able to determine callstacks in the presence of frame pointer optimizations
(FPO) in most cases, but if you see strange callstacks in an optimized
application consider disabling FPO: for cl.exe, "/Oy-"; for gcc or g++,
"-fno-omit-frame-pointer".

If your application links with a static library that was built with frame
pointer optimizations and you observe missing frames on your callstacks,
try running with the option "-no_callstack_use_top_fp".  This will add some
additional overhead on malloc-intensive applications, but should eliminate
skipped frames.

The Visual Studio compiler's /RTC1 flag can prevent Dr. Memory from
reporting uninitialized reads of local variables, and the /RTC1 checks for
uninitialized reads themselves may not catch everything that Dr. Memory
finds.  However, /RTC1 does perform additional stack checks that Dr. Memory
does not, so for best results, your application should be run under
Dr. Memory without /RTC1, and run natively with /RTC1.

********************
\subsection sec_invocation Invoking Dr. Memory

Run your application as you normally would from a command prompt (on
Windows, either the \p cmd shell or a Cygwin prompt), with \p \FRONT_END
and "--" prefixed to the command line (the "--" separates any arguments to
Dr. Memory from the application being run).

\par
<tt>~/DrMemory-\PLATFORM-\TOOL_VERSION-1/\FRONT_END_PATH -- \if WINDOWS c:/path/to/my/app \else /path/to/my/app \endif args to my app
</tt>

\if WINDOWS
On Windows, if you used the installer and checked the box to add \p
\FRONT_END to your PATH, you can simply type into your shell:

\par
<tt>\FRONT_END -- c:/path/to/my/app args to my app
</tt>

You can also drag-and-drop your application onto \p \FRONT_END in 
Windows Explorer or on the Desktop if you requested a Desktop shorcut upon
installation.

\endif

When running scripts it is best to explicitly invoke the interpreter rather
than invoking the script directly.  For example:

\par
<tt>~/DrMemory-\PLATFORM-\TOOL_VERSION-1/\FRONT_END_PATH -- /usr/bin/perl ./myscript.pl
</tt>

********************
\subsection sec_results Examining the Results

Dr. Memory's results are written to a file called \p results.txt inside a
subdirectory created for each invocation of Dr. Memory, inside Dr. Memory's
log directory.  The log directory by default is the \p logs subdirectory of
the unpacked installation, or the Dr. Memory directory inside your profile
directory when Dr. Memory is installed into Program Files on Windows.  It can be
changed with the \p -logdir option:

\par
<tt>~/DrMemory-\PLATFORM-\TOOL_VERSION-1/\FRONT_END_PATH -logdir \if WINDOWS c:/logs \else /tmp/drmem \endif -- myapp
</tt>

When an application is executed under Dr. Memory's control, it creates a
subdirectory in the base log directory named
"DrMemory-<appname>.<pid>.NNN", where NNN is a counter that is incremented
to ensure unique names.

On Windows, the results files is automatically opened in \p notepad when
the application exits.  This only occurs for the top-level process; if it
created child processes, they will be followed by Dr. Memory and have their
own result directories and files, but these will not be automatically
displayed.  The option \p -batch can be used to disable the launch of \p
notepad at application exit.

For full details on the errors reported by Dr. Memory, see \ref sec_errors.

If you would like to attach a debugger at the point an error is first
detected, use the \p -pause_at_unaddressable or \p -pause_at_uninitialized
options (see \ref page_options).

********************
\subsection sec_children Controlling Child Processes

By default, Dr. Memory monitors all child processes.  To disable this
behavior and not monitor any children, use this option:

\par
<tt>~/DrMemory-\PLATFORM-\TOOL_VERSION-1/\FRONT_END_PATH -no_follow_children
</tt>

To follow all children except certain applications, run this command with
the executable name of each application you do not wish to monitor, prior
to running Dr. Memory with default options:

\par
<tt>~/DrMemory-\PLATFORM-\TOOL_VERSION-1/\DRCONFIG_PATH -quiet -reg myapp -norun
</tt>

This \p -norun request is permanent and affects all subsequent Dr. Memory
executions by the user that issued the \p -norun request.  To undo it, use
this command:

\par
<tt>~/DrMemory-\PLATFORM-\TOOL_VERSION-1/\DRCONFIG_PATH -quiet -unreg myapp
</tt>

********************
\subsection sec_aggregate Aggregating Results From Multiple Processes

Dr. Memory supports aggregating results from multiple log directories,
whether from multiple processes of a multi-process application or from
multiple runs of the same application.  Simply use the \p -aggregate option
and supply the list of log directories, or a single directory containing
the log directories as sub-directories to aggregate all of them:

\par
<tt>~/DrMemory-\PLATFORM-\TOOL_VERSION-1/\FRONT_END_PATH -aggregate DrMemory-myapp.1234.000 DrMemory-myapp.1235.000 
</tt>

\par
<tt>~/DrMemory-\PLATFORM-\TOOL_VERSION-1/\FRONT_END_PATH -aggregate /parent/logdir/
</tt>

Currently the \p -aggregate option is not available on Windows.

********************
\subsection sec_daemon Applications That Do Not Exit

While Dr. Memory updates the \p results.txt file as the application runs,
it does not perform leak checking or produce a summary of errors until the
end of the run.  For applications that do not have a normal exit, such as
daemons, Dr. Memory provides a method of forcing end-of-run actions.

Run \p \FRONT_END with the \p -nudge option and the process identifier of
the application in order to request leak checking and other end-of-run
actions:

\par
<tt>~/DrMemory-\PLATFORM-\TOOL_VERSION-1/\FRONT_END_PATH -nudge processid
</tt>

********************
\subsection sec_twostep Post-Run Symbol Processing

Some applications have very large symbol files.  To reduce resource usage
during an application run, symbol processing can be disabled while the
application executes and instead be performed after the run.  Use the \p
-skip_results option when running the application.  Once finished, re-run
Dr. Memory with the \p -results option and the log directory created during
the run (which contains the raw data):

\par
<tt>~/DrMemory-\PLATFORM-\TOOL_VERSION-1/\FRONT_END_PATH -skip_results -- myapp myargs
</tt>

\par
<tt>~/DrMemory-\PLATFORM-\TOOL_VERSION-1/\FRONT_END_PATH -results DrMemory-myapp.9876.000
</tt>

If \p -results is invoked on a different machine where the application
executable is not located at the same path as when it was executed with \p
-skip_results, use the \p -results_app parameter to specify the executable
along with the \p -results parameter.

The \p -skip_results option is not currently available on Windows.

********************
\subsection sec_syslib_syms System Library Symbols

On Linux, Dr. Memory will look in the default debug directories for symbols
for a library: a <tt>.debug</tt> subdirectory of the library's directory or
in <tt>/usr/lib/debug</tt>.

On Windows, the <tt>_NT_SYMBOL_PATH</tt> environment variable is honored by
Dr. Memory as a local cache of \p pdb files.  However, Dr. Memory does not
support symbol store paths (those that contain \p srv).

********************
\subsection sec_suppress Suppressing Errors

Dr. Memory generates a file named \p suppress.txt alongside the \p
results.txt file.  To suppress errors from being reported in future runs,
edit this file to contain just the errors you wish to suppress.  Then pass
the file to \p \FRONT_END with the -suppress option:

\par
<tt>~/DrMemory-\PLATFORM-\TOOL_VERSION-1/\FRONT_END_PATH -suppress \if WINDOWS c:/suppress-custom.txt \else /tmp/suppress-custom.txt \endif -- myapp
</tt>

The suppress.txt generated by Dr. Memory will contain suppression information
only for those errors that weren't suppressed using the -suppress option.  For
each error reported in suppress.txt, there will be two types of call stacks,
one showing \p <module+offset> type frames and the other \p module!function
type frames.  The offset in \p <module+offset> must be a lower-case hexadecimal
constant (e.g., \p 0x4af) and is the offset from the start of the module.
Either type of call stack can be used and it is enough if one
of those two is specified.   The \p module!function are more general and
more robust across different versions of a module.

In order to simplify writing suppressions, callstacks support "*" and "?"
wildcards in either the module or function name (or offset for \p
<module+offset>).  A "*" matches any number of characters of any kind.  A
"?" matches a single character of any kind.  C++ functions should be in
their unmangled form.  If a literal "*" is desired, a "?" should usually be
used instead to avoid the "*" wildcard expansion.

To match any frame at all, use a single "*".  To match any module but not
any non-module (and thus not match a system call or non-module code, such
as generated code), use "*!*".

Callstacks automatically employ prefix matching.  Prefix matching
means that the callstack in the suppression file is considered a match if
it matches the top of any actual callstack during a run.  This allows
specifying only the first few frames of a callstack and have it match any
callstack whose first frames match those frames, regardless of subsequent
frames.

A final type of wildcard frame is supported: "...".  A callstack frame
consisting of the string "..." matches zero or more frames in the
callstack.

As a variation on the "..." ellipsis frame, "module!..." matches one or
more frames in a given module.  Importantly, it will not match zero frames
like a plain ellipsis.  This form is most useful for suppressing reports
through system libraries that are missing symbols, because oftentimes such
reports can be identified by the way they call back and forth across system
library boundaries.

Suppression files can have empty lines and comment lines (begining with #).
There should be no leading white space for the actual suppression information.
Suppressions should not end with "...", which is unnecessary due to the implicit
prefix matching.

A suppression can be given an identifier with a \p name= line after
the error type line.  Suppressions that were matched are printed in the
results file with a count of how many unique callstacks were matched.
Duplicate callstacks are not included.  Here is an example:

\code
LEAK
name=bug #456 (deliberately leaked object)
mylib.dll!LeakMe
mylib.dll!*
\endcode

On Windows, for unaddressable accesses and uninitialized reads, a
suppression can be further restricted by the actual instruction involved.
The instruction is printed out in an error report in a \p Note: field.  For
example:
\code
Error #8: UNADDRESSABLE ACCESS: reading 0x001338a8-0x001338ac 4 byte(s)
...
Note: instruction: mov    (%eax) -> %eax
\endcode

A suppression can contain an \p instruction= line after the error type line
which will be matched against this note field.  It can contain wildcards.
The \p instruction= line is currently ignored on Linux.  Here is
an example:

\code
UNINITIALIZED READ
name=bug #123 (deliberate uninitialized read to generate random number)
instruction=test   * $0x00000?00
myranlib.dll!GenRanHelper*
myranlib.dll!GenRan*
\endcode

For users with existing Valgrind Memcheck suppression files, Dr. Memory
supports Valgrind-style suppressions, but not with mangled C++ symbols.
On Linux, a script called \p valgrind2drmemory.pl is provided in the bin
directory that can be used to convert a legacy Valgrind suppression file to
the Dr. Memory format.  It uses heuristics to convert mangled C++ symbols
that contain wildcards and may not succeed on complex types (it prints a
warning for those it fails on).  Use it like this:

\code
bin/valgrind2drmemory.pl /path/to/old-supp-file /path/to/new-drmem-towrite
\endcode

The Dr. Memory suppression format is more powerful then the Valgrind format
and matches the Windows module!function standards used by other tools.  We
recommend converting to the Dr. Memory format from a legacy format.

Another method of ignoring errors is to filter the reported errors to focus
on particular source files.  Use the \p -srcfilter option to do this:

\par
<tt>~/DrMemory-\PLATFORM-\TOOL_VERSION-1/\FRONT_END_PATH -srcfilter hello.c -- ./hello
</tt>

The \p -srcfilter option is not available in the Windows version of Dr. Memory.

To get more information on what errors are being suppressed, run with
\p -log_suppressed_errors.  All suppressed reports will be printed to the global
logfile.

Dr. Memory comes with a set of default suppressions to avoid known false
positives in system libraries.  These can be disabled with the option
-no_default_suppress.

********************
\subsection sec_replace Replaced Routines

Dr. Memory replaces several string and memory routines in the C library,
executable, and other libraries, in order to avoid false positives from
extremely-optimized versions of these routines.  So if an application
expects a crash inside a routine like \p strlen, do not be alarmed if it
shows up as \p replace_strlen in the Dr. Memory library rather than \p
strlen in the C library.

********************
\subsection sec_light Light Mode

Dr. Memory provides a "light" mode that detects fewer errors in order to
gain performance.  It does not detect uninitialized reads nor leaks.  It
does detect unaddressable accesses, invalid heap arguments, and warnings.
Use the runtime option \p -light to use light mode.

To add leak checking to light mode, add the option \p -count_leaks after
the \p -light option.  This will identify all error types except
uninitialized reads.

\endhtmlonly
\section sec_errors Error Types Reported by Dr. Memory

Each error found by Dr. Memory is listed in the \p results.txt file (see
\ref sec_results).  The error report includes an error number, the type of
error, the address and size of the memory access in question (if applicable
to the error type), a timestamp and thread identifier indicating when and
where the error was detected, and a callstack of the application at the
point of the error.  The thread identifier can be correlated with the
function of a particular thread by locating the thread creation callstack
in the \p global.pid.log file in the same directory as the \p results.txt
file.

The \p -brief option can be used to request simpler and in some cases
easier to read (i.e., more suited to novices) error reports that hide STL
and CRT paths, simplify source paths for the executable by removing the
path containing the executable itself, and omit absolute addresses,
thread timestamps, and instruction disassembly.

The following subsections describe each type of error.  Leaks are described
in \ref sec_leaks.

********************
\subsection sec_unaddr Unaddressable Access

Dr. Memory considers any read or write of a memory location that was not
allocated as an "unaddressable access".  An allocation is:

 - A call to mmap (or mremap) (or Windows equivalents VirtualAlloc or
   MapViewOfFile) outside of a heap or stack region.
 - A call to malloc (or calloc or realloc, or Windows equivalents
   HeapAlloc or HeapReAlloc or the Local or Global versions) inside of a 
   heap region
 - An extension of the stack in a stack region, either via raw instructions
   or via alloca.

An unaddressable access is an access to an invalid memory address.
Examples include a buffer overflow, reading off the end of an array,
reading or writing to memory that has been freed (often referred to as
a "use-after-free" error), reading beyond the top of the stack, etc.

The heap allocator may pad the size requested by the application.  The
padded region beyond what the application asked for is considered
unaddressable by Dr. Memory.

Consider this example code:
\code
char *x = malloc(8);
char c = *(x+8);
\endcode

Here is a diagram of the resulting heap allocation:
\htmlonly
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 border=0>
<tr><td align="right">malloc header:</td>
    <td bgcolor="#fcd6a5" width=50>unaddressable</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">x:            </td>
    <td bgcolor="#a7d588" width=50>uninitialized</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">x + 8:        </td>
    <td bgcolor="#fcd6a5" width=50>unaddressable</td></tr></td></tr>
</table>
\endhtmlonly

Dr. Memory will report an unaddressable access error on the second line of
the example code, because <tt>x+8</tt> is not an addressable location.

When an unaddressable access occurs in a heap region, Dr. Memory attempts
to provide additional information about nearby valid allocations and
whether the target address is inside a region that has been freed.  For
example, here is a sample error report:

\code
Error #1: UNADDRESSABLE ACCESS: reading 0x000a720b-0x000a720c 1 byte(s)
# 0 main                            [e:\derek\drmemory\git\src\tests\malloc.c:96]
Note: @0:00:01.500 in thread 3808
Note: refers to 1 byte(s) beyond last valid byte in prior malloc
Note: prev lower malloc:  0x000a7208-0x000a720b
Note: instruction: mov    0x03(%edx) -> %al
\endcode

Note how the "prev lower malloc" ends at 0x000a720b just before the invalid
address, indicating a read that went one byte too far, as indicated.

Here is another example, using the \p -delay_frees_stack option to obtain
the callstack of the freed memory:

\code
Error #8: UNADDRESSABLE ACCESS: reading 0x001338a8-0x001338ac 4 byte(s)
# 0 unaddr_test1                    [e:\derek\drmemory\git\src\tests\suppress.c:110]
# 1 test                            [e:\derek\drmemory\git\src\tests\suppress.c:269]
# 2 main                            [e:\derek\drmemory\git\src\tests\suppress.c:297]
Note: @0:00:02.141 in thread 3024
Note: next higher malloc: 0x001338e8-0x00133938
Note: prev lower malloc:  0x001337e8-0x00133820
Note: 0x001338a8-0x001338ac overlaps memory 0x001338a8-0x001338c4 that was freed here:
Note: # 0 test                            [e:\derek\drmemory\git\src\tests\suppress.c:269]
Note: # 1 main                            [e:\derek\drmemory\git\src\tests\suppress.c:297]
Note: instruction: mov    (%eax) -> %eax
\endcode

The \p -brief option provides less information but may be easier to read:

\code
Error #8: UNADDRESSABLE ACCESS: reading 4 byte(s)
# 0 unaddr_test1                    [e:\derek\drmemory\git\src\tests\suppress.c:110]
# 1 test                            [e:\derek\drmemory\git\src\tests\suppress.c:269]
# 2 main                            [e:\derek\drmemory\git\src\tests\suppress.c:297]
Note: refers to memory that was freed here:
Note: # 0 test                            [e:\derek\drmemory\git\src\tests\suppress.c:269]
Note: # 1 main                            [e:\derek\drmemory\git\src\tests\suppress.c:297]
\endcode

The \p callstack_style option can be used to customize how callstacks are
printed out.  Here is another style for the same callstack (without -brief):

\code
Error #8: UNADDRESSABLE ACCESS: reading 0x001338a8-0x001338ac 4 byte(s)
# 0 unaddr_test1 (0x0040130b <suppress.exe+0x130b>)

# 2 main (0x0040107e <suppress.exe+0x107e>)
    e:\derek\drmemory\git\src\tests\suppress.c:297
Note: @0:00:01.453 in thread 4088
Note: next higher malloc: 0x001338e8-0x00133938
Note: prev lower malloc:  0x001337e8-0x00133820
Note: 0x001338a8-0x001338ac overlaps memory 0x001338a8-0x001338c4 that was freed here:
Note: # 0 test (0x00401121 <suppress.exe+0x1121>)
Note:     e:\derek\drmemory\git\src\tests\suppress.c:269
Note: # 1 main (0x0040107e <suppress.exe+0x107e>)
Note:     e:\derek\drmemory\git\src\tests\suppress.c:297
Note: instruction: mov    (%eax) -> %eax
\endcode

In this case Dr. Memory is able to report that the target address is inside
a malloc area that has been freed and has not been re-allocated since.

This additional information, and the addresses accessed, only apply to the
first error with that callstack that Dr. Memory sees.  Any subsequent
errors with the same callstack will increment the duplicate count for that
error <em>but further individual information about each duplicate is not
provided</em>.

********************
\subsection sec_uninit Uninitialized Read

If the application reads from addressable memory that has not been written
to since it was allocated, Dr. Memory reports an "uninitialized read"
error.  In order to avoid false positives, Dr. Memory does not report the
use of uninitialized memory until something "meaningful" is done with that
memory, such as a comparison or conditional branch or passing it to a
system call.  Variables or fields smaller than a word are often initialized
without their containing word (variables and fields are typically
word-aligned) being initialized.  When these variables or fields are then
copied, the uninitialized portion of each word is technically being read as
an uninitialized value, but reporting such reads as errors would result in
far too many errors.

When passing data structures to a system call, if the structure is
initialized field-by-field then padding bytes may be left uninitialized.
Dr. Memory will report errors on these as it does not know whether the
kernel or a receipient on the other end might read it.  To avoid these
errors, memset the entire structure, or use a Dr. Memory error suppression
(see \ref sec_suppress) to ignore the error.

Here is an example of an uninitialized read error:

\code
Error #2: UNINITIALIZED READ: reading 0xffbae108-0xffbae114 12 byte(s) within 0xffbae100-0xffbae114
Elapsed time = 0:00:00.214 in thread 19298
system call socketcall setsockopt args
    <system call>
0x08049a65 <my-socket-test+0x1a65> my-socket-test!main
    ??:0
0x0092dbb6 <libc.so.6+0x16bb6> libc.so.6<nosyms>!__libc_start_main
    ??:0
0x080489b1 <my-socket-test+0x9b1> my-socket-test!_start
    ??:0
\endcode

When only part of a larger region is uninitialized, Dr. Memory reports the
containing range to make it easier to track down the problem.  This
typically happens with buffers or structures passed to system calls.  Note
also in this example how Dr. Memory reports which part of the socketcall
system call checks discovered this error.

********************
\subsection sec_invarg Invalid Heap Argument

Whenever a pointer that does not refer to a valid malloc region is passed
to free() or other malloc-related routines, Dr. Memory reports an "invalid
heap argument" error.  Here the problem is immediately apparent as
0x00001234 is not a valid heap address at all:

\code
Error #4: INVALID HEAP ARGUMENT: free 0x00001234
Elapsed time = 0:00:00.180 in thread 21848
# 0 malloc!main                                     [/home/bruening/drmemory/git/src/tests/malloc.c:164]
# 1 libc.so.6!__libc_start_main                     [/build/buildd/eglibc-2.11.1/csu/libc-start.c:226]
# 2 malloc!_start                                  
\endcode

Another common example of an invalid argument is a mismatch in calling
free() versus operator delete versus operator delete[].  This will be
reported as:

\code
Error #4: INVALID HEAP ARGUMENT: allocated with operator new[], freed with operator delete
# 0 test_mismatch                   [cs2bug.cpp:122]
# 1 main                            [cs2bug.cpp:139]
Note: memory was allocated here:
Note: # 0 test_mismatch                   [cs2bug.cpp:121]
Note: # 1 main                            [cs2bug.cpp:139]
\endcode

For code compiled with Visual Studio, detecting such mismatches relies on
having debug information.  Certain Visual Studio optimizations can also
preclude the ability to detect mismatches when using a static C library, so
using either a Debug build of your application or linking to the dynamic C
library may be required to identify these bugs.  Also note that if leak
counting is completely disabled via \p -no-count_leaks then the callstack
of the allocation will not be reported on a mismatch.

\subsection sec_warning Warning

Dr. Memory reports warnings about unusual memory-related conditions that an
application developer might like to know about.  For example:

\code
Error #12: WARNING: heap allocation failed
@0:00:01.500 in thread 3748
# 0 suppress.exe!warning_test1                       [e:\derek\drmemory\git\src\tests\suppress.c:179]
# 1 suppress.exe!test                                [e:\derek\drmemory\git\src\tests\suppress.c:282]
# 2 suppress.exe!main                                [e:\derek\drmemory\git\src\tests\suppress.c:297]
# 3 suppress.exe!__tmainCRTStartup                   [f:\sp\vctools\crt_bld\self_x86\crt\src\crt0.c:327]
# 4 KERNEL32.dll!BaseProcessStart                   
\endcode

Dr. Memory also identifies common errors in using the Windows GDI API and
reports these errors as warnings.  For example:

\code
Error #15: WARNING: GDI usage error: DC 0x2d011230 that contains selected object being deleted
# 0 system call NtGdiDeleteObjectApp                            
# 1 GDI32.dll!DeleteDC                                                        +0x11     (0x76b458c5 <GDI32.dll+0x158c5>)

# 3 chrome.dll!SkRefCnt::unref                                                 [c:\src\chromium\src\third_party\skia\include\core\skrefcnt.h:60]
# 4 chrome.dll!SkRefCnt::unref                                                 [c:\src\chromium\src\third_party\skia\include\core\skrefcnt.h:60]
# 5 chrome.dll!SkCanvas::internalRestore                                       [c:\src\chromium\src\third_party\skia\src\core\skcanvas.cpp:824]
# 6 chrome.dll!SkCanvas::~SkCanvas                                             [c:\src\chromium\src\third_party\skia\src\core\skcanvas.cpp:449]
\endcode

Note that some of these GDI usage errors are best programming practices and
may not result in detrimental behavior in actual usage on more recent
versions of Windows, while others are more serious.
Detection of these errors can be disabled with the \p -no_check_gdi runtime
option.

Dr. Memory also identifies common errors of handle usage in Windows and
reports these errors as warnings. For Example:

\code
Error #1: WARNING: Handle usage error: GDI Handle 0xfd011e11 is created but not closed:
# 0 system call NtGdiCreateCompatibleDC
# 1 test_gdi_handles                                  [d:\src\workspace\drmemory\drmemory.git\tests\handle.cpp:36]
# 2 main                                              [d:\src\workspace\drmemory\drmemory.git\tests\handle.cpp:57]
\endcode

Detection of these errors can be disabled with the \p -no_check_handle runtime option.
