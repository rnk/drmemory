# Dr. Memory default suppression file

# When I use _beginthreadex() I see this leak even when explicitly calling
# _endthread().  Not sure whether csrss frees it when it frees the stack
# but suppressing under the assumption it's a false positive.
# I don't see this when using CreateThread.
LEAK
ntdll.dll!RtlAllocateActivationContextStack
KERNEL32.dll!CreateRemoteThread
KERNEL32.dll!CreateThread

# sometimes it shows up as a possible leak
